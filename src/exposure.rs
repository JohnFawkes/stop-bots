//! Would this host have handed `/.env` to the scanner that asked for it?
//!
//! The probe-paths detector blocks whoever asks for `/.env`, but only
//! after the request has been answered, so whether the answer was a 404
//! or the database password is the question that decides how bad the
//! request was. This asks each of the host's own sites for a short list
//! of such files, over loopback, the way a scanner would, and reports the
//! ones that come back as the file.
//!
//! ## Only what is really the file
//!
//! A 200 is not enough. Plenty of sites answer every path with something:
//! a single-page app serves its `index.html` for any URL, and a CMS its
//! own "not found" page with a 200. So a path counts only if
//!
//! - it is answered 200,
//! - the answer does not look like the one for a path that cannot exist
//!   (same status, content type and length is the site's catch-all), and
//! - the body looks like the file: `[core]` in a `.git/config`, `KEY=`
//!   lines in a `.env`, a key's armour in `id_rsa`.
//!
//! ## Not turned away by our own block
//!
//! The generated config refuses agents by name and requests by shape, and
//! a check that was refused by it would report every site clean. So the
//! requests look like a current browser's ([`USER_AGENT`] and the headers
//! the request rules look for), and a site that answers even the path
//! that cannot exist with the block's status is reported as not checked
//! rather than as clean. The source is loopback, which no detector ever
//! blocks ([`crate::ipranges::is_local_or_private`]), so asking for
//! `/.env` here does not get this host blocked by itself.
//!
//! ## Bounded
//!
//! This runs in every health probe, from cron and the TUI as well as
//! `status`, so the whole survey has a deadline ([`Limits::budget`]), and
//! what has not answered by then is reported as not answering. It never
//! follows a redirect: a redirect is an answer, and not the file.
